# Configuration reference

Every key, its default, what a project file may change, the status line templates, and the update note. The [README](../README.md) covers the common cases; [guards.md](guards.md) explains what each threshold does.

## User config

Paths in this document are for Pi. On oh-my-pi, `~/.pi/agent` is `~/.omp/agent` and the project file is `.omp/pi-warden.json`. `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` sets the agent directory on both hosts. One-time migration for existing oh-my-pi users: an interactive oh-my-pi session shows a notice once per machine, with the two paths filled in. It says to close all Pi and oh-my-pi sessions first (the SQLite database keeps write-ahead logs while a session is open), then run `{ [ ! -e "$HOME/.omp/agent/pi-warden" ] || mv "$HOME/.omp/agent/pi-warden" "$HOME/.omp/agent/pi-warden.before-migration"; } && cp -R "$HOME/.pi/agent/pi-warden" "$HOME/.omp/agent/pi-warden"` — the `mv` keeps the fresh data the new host created aside instead of deleting it — and copy the project file `.pi/pi-warden.json` to `.omp/pi-warden.json` (keep the original so Pi sessions in that project still read it).

User file `~/.pi/agent/pi-warden/config.json` (owner-only). `/warden config` opens the panel that edits it (`s` saves, `/warden config` again or `q` closes); `/warden config get <key>` prints one value without the panel. A key pi-warden does not know is ignored. A value it cannot apply as written (an unknown rule value, a surprising arming duration, a project value that would weaken the action guard or security) is named in one config warning, shown once when a session starts and again in `/warden status`. Missing keys use these defaults:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Master switch for the extension. |
| `typesafe` | Consent to send requests to TypeSafe. Set by `/warden enable`; only the user file or `PI_WARDEN_ENABLED=1` can grant it. |
| `typesafeBackend` | Where the judgments go: `"typesafe"` (default, api.typesafe.ai), `"openrouter"` (openrouter.ai), `"commandcode"` (api.commandcode.ai), local `"kev"` or `"laya"`, or an endpoint object for a gateway that serves the same decisions protocol: `{ "label": "Corp judge gateway", "host": "https://gw.example.com", "path": "/judge/systemone", "keyEnv": "GW_JUDGE_KEY", "defaultModel": "jev-1.13" }`. `keyEnv` is required, must not be `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, and names the environment variable that carries the endpoint's key: the TypeSafe key and the `/typesafe login` store are never sent to it. `path`, `defaultModel`, and the model-list fields `modelsPath`, `modelsField`, `modelsIdField`, `modelsVerifyKey` are optional; the host must be `https:` (`http:` only for a loopback host). User file only — a project must not redirect judgments. Nothing silently falls back: an unknown name or an object the judge refuses turns judgments off, and the refusal message is shown once and in `/warden status`. |
| `mode` | `steer` (hold goes back to the agent), `confirm` (dialog for you), `advise` (never holds). User file only; a project's `.pi/pi-warden.json` cannot change it, by design. |
| `timeoutMs` | Per-request timeout for Jev/Kev and the default for other backends. On timeout the call is allowed with a warning when `action.failOpen` is true. |
| `layaTimeoutMs` | Laya-only request and guard deadline; defaults to `60000` ms for CPU inference after service readiness. User file only. |
| `maxRequests` | Per-session request budget. When spent, pi-warden says so once and continues with offline checks. |
| `action.tools` | Tools the action guard inspects. Add your own shell-like tools here. |
| `action.irreversible` | `warn` and `confirm` (hold) thresholds on P(irreversible). Defaults `warn` 0.5 and `confirm` 0.9. The 0.9 hold waits for the confidence at which the judge stops being wrong: on the recorded action-guard corpus the judge errs on 15% of calls below confidence 0.8 and under 1% above it, and a 0.9 cutoff removed about 52 false alarms on a held-out half of the corpus without losing a true catch. Calls the judge scores 0.5 to 0.9 warn instead of holding. See [guards.md](guards.md#irreversible-hold-threshold-2026-09-29-held-out-split). |
| `action.offTask` | `warn` and `steer` are score thresholds for the off-task reason text in the trace. The warning itself follows the judge's `scope` answer (`unrelated` and `plausible side step` warn at any score). Off-task never holds and every off-task notice is trace-only: no setting makes it reach the agent (the steer is off on the 2026-09-30 blind labels, see [guards.md](guards.md#steer-calibration-2026-09-30-blind-labels)). Only the sampled call (`action.traceSample`) asks the off-task and scope questions; the acting request never does, so with `traceSample: 0` these thresholds have nothing to read. |
| `action.intentMismatch` | P(call differs from the agent's stated plan) that warns and tells the agent, on calls that can change something. |
| `action.visibleMismatch` | Lower mismatch threshold (never above `action.intentMismatch`) for commands whose effect is visible outside the working tree (commit, push, publish, install, launch). |
| `action.intentTraceOnly` | Which intent mismatches stay in the trace without a steer to the agent. `"all"` (default): every mismatch, visible effect or not. `"invisible"`: only a call with no visible effect: not a commit, push, merge, tag, reset, pull request, release, or publish (decided in code), and not judged `visible` at 0.8 or more (an install, a launched program, a message sent from a script). `"none"`: none; every mismatch steers, as before. The steer arrives after the call ran. Blind labels on 140 sampled calls put the score's separation of a differing call at AUROC 0.815, but of the 37 steers that would reach the agent, 36 were calls the plan or the user's latest request had asked for. Restore the old behaviour with `"action": { "intentTraceOnly": "invisible" }`. |
| `action.shouldProceed` | `{ threshold, steer }`. Scores at or below `threshold` (default 0.6) are recorded in the trace and the status counts only by default; they never hold a call. On the 2026-09-30 blind labels 32% of judged calls sat at or below 0.6 while 2 of 427 labelled calls needed asking (see [guards.md](guards.md#steer-calibration-2026-09-30-blind-labels)). By default only the sampled call (`action.traceSample`) asks the question; with `steer: true` every acting request asks it. `hold` is the deprecated name of `threshold`: it is still read through 1.x, and `threshold` wins when both are set. |
| `action.shouldProceed.steer` | Default `false`. Set `true` to restore the steer that asks the agent to pause and seek user approval. The 2026-09-30 labels do not support it: precision 0.01 to 0.06 across thresholds. It puts `should_proceed` on every acting request, so a score at or below `threshold` steers. The ask gate still applies: a call the gate decides offline (see `action.ask`) gets no should-proceed answer, unless `action.ask.enabled` is `false`, which asks every judged call. With `false`, only the sampled call asks the question, and its answer stays trace-only. |
| `action.ask` | `{ enabled }`, default `true`. Whether a call whose answer cannot change what the agent sees is decided offline instead of by a request. On the recorded action traffic from 2026-09-25 to 2026-09-30 it asks 14,326 of 28,036 judged calls (48.9% fewer requests) and still asks 96.7% of the calls whose answer changed what the agent saw. The offline pattern pass and the floor always run. |
| `action.traceSample` | `0` to `1`, default `0.05`: one judged call in twenty also asks the trace-only questions (off-task, scope, should-proceed) in a second request, so the recorded signal keeps coming. The acting request never asks off-task or scope, and asks should-proceed only with `action.shouldProceed.steer: true`. A sampled call's answers go through the off-task and should-proceed checks with the usual thresholds and stay trace-only: nothing new reaches the agent and nothing holds. A call the ask gate decides offline is never sampled. With `0`, no call gets an off-task, scope, or should-proceed answer, except should-proceed under the opt-in steer. |
| `action.feedbackLog` | Write each judged call and its outcome to `~/.pi/agent/pi-warden/holds/`; never the command. |
| `action.floor` | `"evidence"` (default): when a judge answers, built-in pattern hits are evidence in the request, not level-setters. `"level"`: the floor sets the level before the judge, as it did pre-0.31. User-declared rules keep their declared action in both modes. User file only; project files cannot change it. |
| `action.commandRules` | User-defined command rules: `{ id, pattern, severity: "warn" \| "confirm" \| "deny", action?, message?, caseSensitive? }`. `block` is the same as `deny`. A missing `severity` is `warn`; any other value is never downgraded: the rule applies at `confirm` and a config warning names the rule, the value, and the valid values. Patterns match the data-text-stripped command, so heredoc bodies and commit messages do not fire them. `confirm` defaults to `action: "dialog"` (a prompt for you, in every mode); `action: "hold"` restores steer semantics. Patterns are JavaScript regexes matched against full commands, so a pattern with nested quantifiers can be slow on long commands — a pathological one is self-inflicted. User rule ids must not reuse a built-in id (see `EXEMPTABLE_IDS` in `src/guard.ts`); a collision silently drops the user rule. User file only. |
| `action.commandDenyRules` | The same shape, shorthand for `severity: "deny"`: the call is blocked with no dialog and no TypeSafe request. An unknown `severity` here stays `deny`, with the same config warning. User file only. |
| `action.pathRules` | User-defined path rules: `{ id, paths, access, tools, action, message?, onlyIfExists?, regex? }`. `paths` are globs (`**` any depth, `*` one segment, `?` one character, `~` expands; `regex: true` reads them as regexes). `access` is the dimension: `"none"` any touch matches, `"read"` writes are held and reads flow, `"write"` reads are held and writes flow (an append-only log). `tools` picks the surface: file tools by name check the structured `path` field; `"*"` also matches bash commands — a `none` rule fires on a mention anywhere in the data-text-stripped command, and the write side is matched only at redirect (`>`, `>>`) and `tee` targets, never in arbitrary argv. `action`: `note` (the default; the agent is told after the fact), `warn`, `confirm` (a dialog, in every mode), `block` (deny, no dialog); `deny` is the same as `block`, and any other value applies at `confirm` with a config warning. `onlyIfExists` defaults `true`, so phantom paths do not fire. A `read`-scoped rule needs `read` in `action.tools`, which does not inspect the read tools by default. User file only. |
| `action.armingRules` | User-defined arming rules: `{ id, when: { edited, regex?, tools? }, arms: { command, for?, caseSensitive? }, action, message? }`. Editing a file matching a `when.edited` glob arms the rule's `arms.command` regex for `arms.for` (default `"10m"`). A number is milliseconds; a string takes `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h` (`"30s"`, `"1.5h"`), and a string without a unit means minutes. A config warning names a rule that arms for under one second (`"for": 30` is 30 ms) and a string without a unit. While armed, commands matching the regex fire the rule's `action`: `confirm` (dialog), `hold` (steer), `block` (deny); `deny` is the same as `block`, any other value applies at `confirm` with a config warning, and a rule with no `action` is ignored with a config warning. State lives for the rule's window within a session, refreshed on each matching edit, cleared on `session_start`, and shown in `/warden status`. Approving the dialog approves that call, not the window; the dialog re-fires for each matching command while the rule is armed. User file only. |
| `action.exemptRules` | Built-in or user rule ids to exempt, e.g. `["infra-destroy"]` for a workflow whose `kubectl delete` is routine; also `rm-recursive` / `rm-rf` / `rm-recursive-dangerous-target` / `rm-temp-subtree` / `rm-session-scratch` (the `rm` classifier) and `sensitive-path`. An id naming nothing is inert and reported once at startup. Exempting `sensitive-path` removes the only deterministic credential-touch signal, Jev questions aside. User file only. |
| `action.escalationThreshold` | Jev confidence above which a violation's severity is escalated in the blast-radius and rules-guard escalation paths. Default `0.85`. Escalation fires when confidence strictly exceeds this threshold; setting it to `1` effectively disables escalation since noul confidence cannot exceed 1. |
| `rules.enabled` | The rules guard, and whether the resolved rules file content rides action requests at all. `false` keeps that content on this machine. |
| `rules.softThreshold` | Default `0` (off). A score from here up to a rule's cutoff becomes a soft "please double-check" steer, one short sentence in the same message; it never holds and is recorded locally. `0.5` asks the agent to double-check the band from 0.5 up to each rule's cutoff. |
| `rules.*` | Rules source, threshold, path globs, sensitive-path notes. See [guards.md → Rules](guards.md#rules). |
| `rulesAtTurnStart.enabled` | Default `true`. Before each new user message, ask which of the project's rules apply to it and append the ones that do as one short message after the newest message. Costs one request per user turn, in the background: the prompt never waits for it, the message is delivered at the end of a turn whose loop continues (a turn with tool calls where not every result ended the run), and it is dropped, with a trace line, for a turn with no tool call, a batch where every result ended the run, a failed or aborted turn, and a run that ends first. A short continuation or a relayed child report sends no request. A project file may make the reminder stricter, never turn it off. See [guards.md → Rules at turn start](guards.md#rules-at-turn-start). |
| `rulesAtTurnStart.threshold` | Default `0.3`. P(this rule applies) at or above which the rule is named; at most three are named, strongest first. Measured: 68.9% of the rules named apply, 80 of 100 sampled requests name one. A project file may lower the cut (name more rules), never raise it. |
| `slop.*` | Code slop threshold and reply (prose) checks. `prose.audience` is `technical`, `plain`, or free text. |
| `security.threshold` | Written-code risk and tool-output injection threshold. |
| `security.maskOutput` | Default `true`. Before the model sees a tool result, replace every credential value the offline check detects in its text blocks with `[redacted]`: private key blocks, `sk-` keys, GitHub tokens (`ghp_`, `gho_`, `ghu_`, `ghs_`, `ghr_`, `github_pat_`), `AKIA` keys, Slack tokens (`xoxa-`, `xoxb-`, `xoxp-`, `xoxr-`, `xoxs-`), `AIza` keys, JWTs, `KEY=value` assignments whose name is a credential key, `Authorization` and `Bearer` values, and URL passwords (`postgres://user:pass@host`), each only when the value looks like a secret. A value that is a code expression — a call, an index, a member access, a non-null assertion, an arrow body, a template literal, or a type name with type arguments — is not a secret, so source code read back through a tool result keeps its text. Test fixtures, documented examples (`AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`), and the query signatures of signed URLs stay readable. The banner says how many values were masked. Images and other parts are not changed. `false` shows the value and keeps the generic credential banner, because the value is in the agent's context. With masking on, the credential banner is sent only when a value was masked; a detected value that was not masked is traced without a banner. User file only: a project file cannot turn masking off. Masking runs even with the security guard off (`security.enabled: false`); only the user's `security.maskOutput: false` stops it. |
| `stuck.*` | Window of tool results kept, failures before a check, cooldown between checks, same-strategy threshold. |
| `stuck.churnThreshold` | Calls to the same target (the same tool and input key) in the window after which the agent is reported as stuck in a churn, even when each call succeeds with a different output. Default `5`, at most `stuck.window`. |
| `stuck.repeatSteer` | Default `true`. Steer on the 2nd identical call when only provably read-only calls ran between the two calls and the call failed with the same output, or re-read an output the agent already has. Code only, no request. Needs `stuck.nudge`. See [guards.md → Stuck](guards.md#stuck). |
| `stuck.diffLimit` | Default `3000`. Maximum characters of the unified line diff in a stuck-loop diff note. |
| `stuck.tailLimit` | Default `1000`. Characters of the current output tail shown after the diff in a stuck-loop diff note. |
| `stuck.evidence` | Default `true`. Add a compact `evidence` section to each stuck request: the failing test, error, location and pass/fail counts per run, parsed from the run's own output (TAP, jest, vitest, pytest, tsc, eslint, cargo, go, a `make test` script, Playwright), the path and a 600-character diff per `edit`/`write`, and a digest (failed runs, distinct failures, repeated commands, edits between failed runs, and whether the latest failure repeats an earlier one after line numbers, timestamps, temp paths and order are normalised). The whole object is capped at 4 KB; over it the oldest runs go first. Every string is redacted. `false` sends the raw output tails only, as before. Applies to the user and the project file. |
| `done.*` | Completion-claim threshold and whether the agent gets a follow-up turn. |
| `done.uiProof` | Default `true`. After a change to a `done.uiFiles` path, only a `done.visualTools` call after that change counts as proof; passing tests and builds do not. `false` restores the test/build/lint-only rule. |
| `done.uiFiles` | Globs for files whose change shows on screen, matched against `write`/`edit` paths and files a `bash` command writes. `{a,b}` alternatives work; a glob that starts with `!` excludes. The defaults exclude test files. |
| `done.visualTools` | What counts as looking at the result, case-insensitive, successful calls only. `commands`: heads of a shell command segment; `flutter test` counts only for an `integration_test/` or golden path (or `--update-goldens`), `idb` only for its `screenshot` or `ui` subcommand, and `chrome`, `chromium`, or `google-chrome` only with a `commandWords` flag (`--headless --screenshot`). `commandWords`: a word that stands alone as an argument or flag after a `commands` head (`idb screenshot`, `flutter test --screenshot`); the same word after another command (`grep -rn screenshot src`), quoted messages, heredoc bodies, and paths such as `screenshots/` do not count. `tools`: text in a tool name, or in the `tool` an MCP proxy (`mcp`, `mcp__…`) calls. `images`: extensions whose `read` counts. |
| `context.*` | Compression thresholds, retention confidence, duplicate size, recall tool. |
| `context.compactAppendix` | Default `true`. Append a compact evidence appendix to the summary during compaction. |
| `context.dedupeRuns` | Default `true`. A run of at least 20 lines and 1500 characters in a new tool result that exactly repeats (trailing spaces ignored) text already in context on the current branch becomes one line: `[pi-warden: the next N lines repeat an earlier bash result — omitted; full text: <path>]`. The full original is stored in that file. The last 2000 characters and images are never changed. Code only; no request. `false` also turns off `context.dedupeMessages`. |
| `context.dedupeMessages` | Default `false`. With `context.dedupeRuns` also on, cut repeated runs in new user and custom messages the same way. Off by default because a repeat the user sends can itself carry meaning ("here it is again, still failing"), and on recent sessions messages gave about 0.8% of their bytes back. A custom message that Pi appends without an agent turn (`triggerTurn: false`, or unset while the agent is idle) does not pass Pi's `message_end` hook and stays whole. |
| `context.largeOutput.enabled` | Add one question to each judged `bash` request: will the command print far more than the agent needs? Off keeps the question out of the request. Read-only commands (`cat`, `find`, `git log`) skip the judge, so the question does not ride them. |
| `context.largeOutput.threshold` | P(large output) at or above which the agent is told, once per command family (`npm test`, `git log`, `find`) per session, to redirect or filter the command before it runs one like it again. The call is never held or warned. Default `0.85`. |
| `compaction.enabled` | Experimental, off by default, not recommended. Default `false`. Replace the summary Pi's model writes at compaction with a relevance compaction: user messages and assistant text word for word, and the tool calls Jev scores as needed for the current task with their results word for word; see [guards.md → Relevance compaction](guards.md#relevance-compaction). In a replay of 48 recorded compactions its summary was 4.7 times the size of Pi's at the median and kept whole only 1 of the 34 files the agent read again. Try it or improve it; changes that make it smaller or keep what the agent goes back for are welcome. Needs TypeSafe consent; without it Pi's summary runs. User file only: it sends the session to Jev and spends requests, so a project's `.pi/pi-warden.json` cannot turn it on (or off); a project may set the other `compaction` keys. |
| `compaction.keepThreshold` | P(the agent needs this exact content again) at or above which a tool call and its result are kept word for word. Default `0.5`. |
| `compaction.maxSummaryTokens` | Size budget for the summary in tokens (characters / 4). Over it, the threshold rises to 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95 on the same scores; still over, Pi's summary runs. Default `20000`, at least `1000`. |
| `compaction.timeoutMs` | The overall deadline for one compaction; past it Pi's summary runs. Each request is also bounded by the global `timeoutMs`, so a request that takes longer than `timeoutMs` fails and Pi's summary runs, even with time left here. Default `20000`, at most `120000`. |
| `compaction.maxRequests` | Requests one compaction may send. A span that needs more sends nothing, and Pi's summary runs. The compaction also shares the session's `maxRequests` budget with the guards: it sends nothing when its requests would leave fewer than 50 of that budget, and it stops before any request when fewer than 50 remain; either way Pi's summary runs, and judgments stay on for the guards. Default `12`. |
| `compaction.skipProviders` | Providers of the active model for which Pi's summary always runs. Default `["claude-bridge"]`, because pi-claude-bridge compacts its own models. |
| `context.filter` | Beta, default `{ "enabled": false, "chunkChars": 2000, "minScore": 1.5, "maxKeptChars": 6000, "timeoutMs": 4000 }`. When on, an output that would get the generic head/diagnostic/tail excerpt is split at line boundaries into chunks of about `chunkChars`; Jev scores each chunk 0 to 3 for the agent's current task, and chunks at or above `minScore` are kept word for word in original order, up to `maxKeptChars` including the last 1000 characters. Parser excerpts, `all`, duplicates, and repeated runs are unchanged. On an error, a timeout after `timeoutMs`, no consent, an exhausted request budget, or no chunk at `minScore`, the excerpt is used. Costs one or more requests per filtered output. `enabled` is read from the user file only: a project file may tune `chunkChars`, `minScore`, `maxKeptChars`, and `timeoutMs`, but cannot turn the filter on, because that sends whole redacted outputs to the judge and spends requests. See [guards.md](guards.md#context-filter-beta-off-by-default). |
| `runaway.*` | Repeat counts that abort a reply, minimum size, whether the agent gets one recovery turn. `repeats` and `thinkingRepeats` are at least 2. |
| `notify.*` | Desktop notifications, cooldown, optional relay command (user file only). |
| `judge.failuresBeforeCooldown` | Consecutive timeout, network, or other judge failures before judgments pause for the session (3). One auth or configuration failure pauses at once. |
| `judge.cooldownMs` | How long a failing judge is left alone before the next action asks it again (60000), capped at 600000 (10 minutes). |
| `subagent.enabled` | Read async subagent reports at all. `false` ignores them, as before 0.14. |
| `subagent.wake` | Ask Jev whether a report that names trouble deserves a wake. `false` keeps the offline layer, which never wakes. |
| `subagent.threshold` | P(report needs the agent awake) that wakes it. Conservative on purpose. |
| `subagent.cooldownMs` | At most one batched wake per window, so several children finishing together cost one interruption. |
| `widget.*` | Status line placement, sidebar shortcut and width, per-guard text templates (below). |
| `widget.barMode` | `"live"` (default): the status line shows only the latest event, as one sentence. `"stack"`: one line per guard with the templates below, folded as described in [Status line and trace sidebar](#status-line-and-trace-sidebar). |
| `learning.patternAnalysis` | Analyze hold patterns and generate recommendations. |
| `learning.retentionDays` | Days to keep hold records in SQLite before pruning. Records older than this are deleted on startup. `0` disables pruning. Default: `365`. |
| `learning.allowedRetentionDays` | Days to keep the records of calls that were not held. They repeat the turn's task text and are the bulk of the file, so they are pruned sooner than a hold. `0` disables this pruning. Default: `90`. |
| `conscience.enabled` | Master switch for the conscience coach. Default `false` — the coach ships as **beta**: off until you flip this one switch. |
| `conscience.skills.mode` | `"off"` (no skill selection), `"recommend"` (name a skill and ask the agent to load it), or `"load"` (supply instructions directly from disk). Default `"recommend"`. `load` requires global consent, a trusted project, and reads the skill file bounded by `maxSkillBytes` and `maxLoadedBytes`. A project cannot upgrade from `recommend` to `load` when the user permits only `recommend`. |
| `conscience.skills.exclude` | Case-sensitive skill names to exclude; `*` is the only wildcard. Default `[]`. |
| `conscience.tools.enabled` | Suggest tools including evidence/research tools; never execute or enable them directly. Default `true`. |
| `conscience.tools.exclude` | Case-sensitive tool names to exclude; `*` is the only wildcard. Default `[]`. |
| `conscience.skipTools` | Exact tool names the conscience never recommends: core tools the agent already uses on nearly every turn. Skills are never skipped by this list. `[]` makes every tool a candidate again. Default `["read", "bash", "edit", "write", "grep", "find", "ls"]`. Independent of this key, a tool whose name has a destructive part (`delete`, `drop`, `destroy`, `remove`, `purge`, `wipe`, `reset`, `truncate`, `kill`, `force`, `uninstall`, `revoke`, `erase`, `clear`; a camelCase name such as `deleteIssue` is split into words) or whose description starts with one is never a candidate. |
| `conscience.timeoutMs` | Total wall-clock deadline for one assessment (ms). Effective deadline is `min(conscience.timeoutMs, timeoutMs)`. Range 100–10000. Default `3000`. |
| `conscience.maxAssessments` | Max assessments per admitted operator prompt, including the initial. Range 1–10. Default `3`. |
| `conscience.maxNudges` | Max new guidance deliveries per admitted operator prompt. Range 1–5. Default `2`. |
| `conscience.maxSkillBytes` | Max UTF-8 bytes per skill file for automatic loading. Range 1024–131072. Default `32768`. |
| `conscience.maxLoadedBytes` | Max cumulative automatic loading bytes per admitted prompt. Range 1024–262144. Default `65536`. |
| `conscience.recommendThreshold` | `P(useful now)` must reach this to select a candidate for recommendation. Default `0.80` (beta policy, measured 2026-09-22). |
| `conscience.advanceThreshold` | `P(advance)` from the disposition question must reach this before a candidate is considered. Default `0.70` (beta policy). |
| `conscience.localTopK` | Candidates the local ranker keeps for Jev; the rest never reach a request. Range 1–256. Default `31`, the most a single request holds. |
| `conscience.localFloor` | Local BM25 score against the request and the task spine; below it the conscience sends no request at all. Range 0–20. Default `0.5`. |
| `prefs.enabled` | Default `true`. `/warden prefs` reads the earlier session files of this project and its other git worktrees for preferences you repeated. `false` (or `enabled: false`) reads no session file. |
| `prefs.inject` | Default `true`. At session start, send the standing preferences that pass every injection rule to the agent as one context message: at most 5 items and 400 characters, each quoted as said with its session count, ending with "If the current request says otherwise, follow the current request." A preference is injected only when you typed it (not a relayed message), in a standing form (`don't`, `never`, `always`, `stop`, `from now on`, `next time`, `I told you`; no question and no temporary word such as `yet`, `now`, `until`, `this PR`, `this branch`), not bound to one task (no pronoun-only object, ticket, branch, PR number, or hash), in 3 or more sessions on 2 or more days, last within 30 days, not lifted by a later message, and not weakening a check (skipping tests, checks, reviews, or confirmations, turning warden off, or pushing, deploying, or deleting without asking). A prohibition of a harmful action ("never check in secrets", "don't commit to main") is a safety preference and is injected. Agent lessons from `warden_remember` share the budget after your preferences, and only once confirmed. `/warden prefs` shows each item as injected or the rule that kept it out; `/warden prefs forget <n>` drops one for the project. Preference text goes to the session model only, never to TypeSafe. Not a steer; it does not use the steer budget. Sent once per session; a resumed session is not sent it again. `false` sends nothing and keeps `/warden prefs`. |
| **Activation gate** | When a measured policy exists (`{ questionHash, model, recommendThreshold, advanceThreshold, loadThreshold }`), the module delivers only when the current hash and model match the policy. Without a matching policy, no recommendation message is sent regardless of the configured thresholds; the assessment is traced with `no_policy`. No production config switch bypasses measurement. |
| **Capability index** | `/warden index` builds a local index at `~/.pi/agent/pi-warden/index/global.json` (global skills and all tools) and `~/.pi/agent/pi-warden/index/projects/<sha256(projectRoot).slice(0,12)>.json` (project skills). Entries carry `lead`, `useWhen`, `examples`, and `role` instead of bare descriptions. The conscience uses index entries when the source hash matches; bare descriptions are the fallback. Index files are owner-only and built locally by the session model; only sanitized entries reach Jev; advertised locations never do. |

After building, `/warden index` reports which skill and tool descriptions would recommend better with a rewrite. This is advice for the author's own skill files — nothing is changed automatically. The index prompt expects the description shape: trigger word first in `lead`, situations in `useWhen`, example user phrasings in `examples`.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `steerVisible` | Show steer messages in the transcript instead of only in the trace panel. |
| `notices` | Print the per-call warning notices (`warden · …`) in the transcript. Off by default; the widget, the trace panel, and `/warden trace` always show every event. |
| `steerBudget` | Steers delivered to the agent per run before further non-critical ones are recorded in the trace only. Every delivered steer costs at least one LLM turn, and a closing run that collects six notices collects six restatements of the final status. `0` disables the budget. Critical guards (stuck, done, runaway recovery, subagent wake) always deliver. |
| `steers.adaptive` | Default `true`. A steer kind that a model rarely follows or often disputes becomes trace-only for that model; see [adaptive steers](guards.md#adaptive-steers-per-model). User file only. |
| `steers.minSteers` | Observed steers of one kind for one model before that pair can become trace-only. Default `30`. |
| `steers.minFollowed` | Trace-only when the share followed is under this. Default `0.2`. Kinds with no follow measure (`prose`, `sensitive-path`) are judged by disputes alone. |
| `steers.maxDisputed` | Trace-only when the share disputed is over this. Default `0.4`. |
| `steers.recheckEvery` | A trace-only pair is re-checked after this many further steers. Default `30`. |
| `steers.probeEvery` | While trace-only, 1 in this many steers is still sent, so the re-check has fresh data. Default `5`. |
| `waste.enabled` | Default `true`. Master switch for the call-waste notes and the session tip. A note is text added to the tool result that triggers it, so it costs no request and never holds or blocks a call, spends the steer budget, or makes a model or TypeSafe call. The notes are on by default; the tip is opt-in (`waste.tip`). See [guards.md → Call waste](guards.md#call-waste). |
| `waste.tip` | Default `false`; the tip is opt-in. When `true`, the one paragraph in [guards.md → Call waste](guards.md#call-waste) is appended to the system prompt on the first run of a session; later runs re-append the same text, so it stays in the prompt and the host records one change. It ships off because the five-repeat A/B on the weak suite measured no change in tokens or turns beyond run-to-run noise (`eval/reports/2026-09-26-waste-tip-5x/`). The four notes are unaffected and stay on. |
| `waste.every` | Tool calls between two notes from the same detector in one session. Default `20`, at least `2`. |
| `waste.sleep` | Default `true`. A `sleep` poll is `sleep N`, optionally after `cd DIR &&`, optionally followed by one short status command (`sleep 30 && gh pr checks 12`, `sleep 5; curl -s URL \| jq .x`). The note fires on the 2nd poll in the last 10 calls. A loop that sleeps is not a poll. |
| `waste.paging` | Default `true`. A ranged read is `read` with `offset` or `limit` and at most 100 lines, `sed -n 'a,bp' F`, `head`/`tail -n N` with N at most 100, or `awk 'NR>=a && NR<=b'`. The note fires on the 3rd ranged read of one file in the last 10 calls when the reads are adjacent or overlapping and nothing wrote that file between them, and it names the one read that covers the same lines. |
| `waste.search` | Default `true`. A search is `grep` or `rg` on one named file, not a glob and not `-r`. The note fires on the 3rd search of one file in the last 10 calls when two of them use the same or an overlapping pattern and nothing wrote that file between them. |
| `waste.recheck` | Default `true`. A check is a test, lint, typecheck, or build command (`npm test`, `npm run check`, `npx tsc`, `eslint`, `vitest`, `jest`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `cargo test`, `go test`, `make test`, `flutter test`, `dart analyze`, and their `bun`/`pnpm`/`uv` forms). The note fires when the same runner and target runs again in the last 10 calls with a different output filter, the earlier output was cut by a pipe, the earlier result showed no failure, and nothing wrote a file in between. |

### Local judgment services

Selecting `"kev"` or `"laya"` starts only that package-owned Docker Compose service on the first actual judgment; Docker with Compose is required. Both published ports bind to loopback, and `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is never sent to either service. Use `/warden enable` as usual for consent; local judgments do not need a Jev key. Kev uses its supported OpenAI backend (`KEV_OPENAI_API_KEY`, optional `KEV_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and `KEV_OPENAI_MODEL`; `KEV_MODEL` defaults to `kev-latest`). Optional service auth uses `KEV_API_KEY` or `LAYA_API_KEY`. Laya keeps its Hugging Face model cache in a named Docker volume; set `HF_TOKEN` for gated downloads if needed. Its first start can take longer while model weights download; CPU inference uses `layaTimeoutMs` (default 60 seconds), independently of Jev/Kev's `timeoutMs`. If Laya logs its `choice:11+` calibration fallback warning, current Warden questions do not use that bucket: the largest fixed choice has nine options, and dynamic choice locators are capped at six. This does not establish calibration for other Laya outputs or suppress the upstream warning.

### Removed in 1.0

`conscience.loadThreshold` and `learning.adaptiveThresholds` (documented in 0.74.1) are removed. A user file or a project file that still sets one loads, ignores the key, and adds one config warning for it. The conscience names a skill and asks the agent to load it; no score loads a skill by itself, and `conscience.skills.mode` is the only switch. Thresholds never change on their own; `/warden recommend` suggests changes from your hold history and you apply them.

## Project config

A project may add `.pi/pi-warden.json` with `enabled` and per-guard overrides: thresholds, extra guarded tools, `rules.files`, `rules.skip`, `rules.sensitivePaths`, or `"done": { "enabled": false }`. Project files are read only when Pi trusts the project. They can never grant `typesafe` consent, change `typesafeBackend` or `mode`, raise `timeoutMs` or `maxRequests`, set `notify.command`, turn relevance compaction on or off (`compaction.enabled`), turn the context filter on or off (`context.filter.enabled`), or turn `security.maskOutput` off. The `widget`, `steers`, `learning`, `conscience`, `steerVisible`, `notices`, and `steerBudget` keys, and the user-declared rule lists and `action.floor` of the action guard, are read from the user file only. A key a project file cannot set at all is ignored without a warning.

A project file may make the action guard and security stricter, never weaker. These keys take the project value only when it is at least as strict as the user's value (from the user file, or the default):

| Key | Taken from a project file | Ignored |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled`, `action.enabled`, `security.enabled` | `true` | `false` |
| `action.irreversible.warn`, `action.irreversible.confirm`, `security.threshold` | a value at or below the user's | a value above the user's |
| `action.tools` | the tools it adds | leaving a tool out: it stays guarded |
| `action.failOpen` | `false` | `true` when the user's value is `false` |
| `action.ask.enabled` | `true` | `false` |
| `rulesAtTurnStart.enabled` | `true` | `false` |
| `rulesAtTurnStart.threshold` | a value at or below the user's (names more rules) | a value above the user's |

Each ignored value gives one config warning. Every other key a project file may set, including the other guards' switches and thresholds, stays tunable both ways.

A wince-style setup for a backend repo (the full version is [`examples/pi-warden.json`](../examples/pi-warden.json)):

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "skip": ["tests/**", "**/*.test.*", "docs/**", "**/*.md"],
    "exclude": ["secrets/**", "**/*.pem"],
    "sensitivePaths": {
      "migrations/**": "This touches a migration: tell the user and add a rollback path",
      "**/permissions*": "Access control changed: ask the user for a security review before merging"
    }
  }
}
```

## Recipe: security work

### What leaves the machine

For penetration testing, incident response, vulnerability research, CTF, and hardening work, where the day touches credentials, scanners, and hostile samples. Nothing leaves until `/warden enable`. After that, each guarded call sends a redacted, truncated summary of the call (tool, command or path, the agent's stated plan), your latest request, and the resolved rules content — `pi-warden.md`, or the files in `rules.files`, or the `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `README.md` fallback — which rides the acting request only while a violation is open. Up to eight earlier messages as task context and the rules content ride only the trace sample, one judged call in twenty (`action.traceSample`). A `write` or `edit` adds a sample of the written code; the security and context guards add redacted tool-output samples; stuck sends recent commands and output tails, plus the parsed failures and capped edit diffs of its `evidence` section; the done-check sends the final message. Redaction (`src/redact.ts`) replaces credential shapes — `Authorization`, `TOKEN=`, `sk-`, `ghp_`, `AKIA`, JWTs, PEM blocks, URL passwords — and nothing else: it is not a path scrubber, so hostnames, IP addresses, and file paths travel as written. [data-handling.md](data-handling.md) lists every field per guard.

For nothing at all, `/warden disable`: the offline layer keeps working: built-in patterns, your own `commandRules` and `pathRules`, `rules.sensitivePaths` notes, duplicate detection, and the runaway guard. Everything that needs a judgment stops with it, including the done-check.

### Local-only profile

Keeps the pattern floor and the done-check; sends no written code, no tool-output samples, and no subagent reports. User file `~/.pi/agent/pi-warden/config.json`:

```json
{
  "action": { "tools": ["bash"] },
  "rules": { "enabled": false },
  "slop": { "enabled": false },
  "security": { "enabled": false },
  "context": { "enabled": false },
  "subagent": { "enabled": false }
}
```

- `action.tools` — only bash is inspected, so no `write` or `edit` content sample is ever built; file writes lose the action guard too.
- `rules.enabled` — no rules-guard request, so no exploit or tooling source is judged against a README, and no rules file content rides the action requests either.
- `slop.enabled` — drops the slop questions, which carry written code.
- `security.enabled` — no tool-output or written-code sample for the weakness check.
- `context.enabled` — large tool output is never sampled for compression; long scanner output stays in the transcript whole.
- `subagent.enabled` — child reports are never sampled, and never wake the agent.

One residue: a judged bash call still sends its redacted summary and the task context. Only `action.enabled: false` (which also removes the pattern checks) or `/warden disable` stops that.

### Lab profile

Project file `.pi/pi-warden.json` in the lab or CTF repo (a project file is read only when Pi trusts the project):

```json
{
  "rules": { "exclude": ["exploits/**", "samples/**", "**/*.pcap"] }
}
```

- `rules.exclude` — those paths are never sent to Jev at all; `rules.skip` is the weaker form (still local, rules just do not apply).

A project file cannot turn the security guard off. To stop fixtures that are supposed to hold a hardcoded secret or a disabled TLS check from firing, set `"security": { "enabled": false }` in the user file; that turns the check off in every project, so turn it back on when the lab work ends.

The exemptions belong in the user file — `action.exemptRules`, `commandRules`, `commandDenyRules`, `pathRules`, `armingRules`, and `action.floor` are user-only keys, silently ignored in a project file, so a checked-out repo cannot ship itself a hold-free floor:

```json
{ "action": { "exemptRules": ["sensitive-path", "remote-script-exec", "chmod-777"] } }
```

- `sensitive-path` — stops the hold on every `cat .env`, ssh config, `auth.json`, keystore, and fake-secret fixture. It is the only deterministic credential-touch signal, so real credential reads go unflagged too, Jev's questions aside.
- `remote-script-exec` — lets a lab setup pipe a remote script into a shell without a hold; a hostile URL in that shape is no longer caught offline.
- `chmod-777` — lets the lab's broad permissions pass; the same command on a production path passes too.

### Engagement hard stop and measuring your own rate

A deny rule blocks a call outright: no dialog, no TypeSafe request. Command rules are matched in code and never sent, and a match travels only as its id, so the hosts you name stay on this machine. Replace the placeholders below with the out-of-scope hosts from your own scope document (user file):

```json
{
  "action": { "commandRules": [
    { "id": "out-of-scope-target", "pattern": "\\b(?:out-of-scope\\.example|other-tenant\\.example)\\b", "severity": "deny", "message": "Not in the signed engagement scope — check the scope document first." }
  ] }
}
```

It is a backstop for sanctioned work, not a boundary anyone hostile respects: keep the pattern short and update it when the scope changes. After a week on these settings, run `node scripts/hold-stats.mjs` for your own hold rate and the ids behind it, then exempt or re-enable from your own numbers — the rates in the README come from the maintainer's corpus, and security work fires a different mix of patterns.

## Environment

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | Takes precedence over the key stored by `/warden enable` or `/typesafe login`. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | API key for the OpenRouter backend. Required when `typesafeBackend` is `"openrouter"`. |
| `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY` | API key for the Command Code backend. Required when `typesafeBackend` is `"commandcode"`. |
| `KEV_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `KEV_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `KEV_OPENAI_MODEL`, `KEV_MODEL` | Kev uses the OpenAI backend; the model id defaults to `kev-latest`, while `KEV_OPENAI_MODEL` defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`. |
| `KEV_API_KEY`, `LAYA_API_KEY` | Optional Bearer keys for matching local HTTP services; neither is required to use a local backend. |
| `HF_TOKEN`, `LAYA_DEVICE`, `LAYA_PRELOAD`, `LAYA_MODELS`, `LAYA_THREADS` | Optional Laya download, device, preload, model, and thread settings; model cache persists in a named Docker volume. |
| `PI_WARDEN_ENABLED=1` | Grants consent for headless runs (same as `"typesafe": true`). |
| `PI_WARDEN_MODE=steer\|confirm\|advise` | Overrides `mode`. |
| `PI_WARDEN_DB=<path>` | SQLite file for the hold records, instead of `holds.db` next to the user config. |
| `PI_WARDEN_STEER_STATS=<path>` | File for the adaptive-steer counts, instead of `steer-stats.json` next to the user config. |
| `PI_WARDEN_INDEX_DIR=<dir>` | Directory whose `pi-warden/index/` holds the `/warden index` files. Wins over `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`; a leading `~` is the home directory. |
| `PI_WARDEN_TRACE_DIR=<absolute path>` | Appends the trace to `<path>/<session id>.jsonl`, one file per Pi session. For a host that runs Pi in RPC mode, where the status line and the sidebar never show. An empty or relative path turns it off. See [Trace file](#trace-file). |
| `PI_WARDEN_HOST_PATHS=<dir>:<dir>` | Directories outside the project where the host lets its agent write, `:`-separated. A `write` or `edit` in one of them, after `..` and symlinks are resolved, is not held or warned by the outside-project rule. Every other check still applies: command rules, path rules, deny rules, sensitive paths, secrets, and Jev; the action summary still shows the path as outside the project, and the rules guard still does not judge these files against the project rules. Relative entries, empty entries, and `/` are ignored. Read once per session. Environment only: no config file can set or extend it. pi-warden's index directory (`pi-warden/index/` under Pi's agent directory), where `/warden index` asks the agent to write, is always treated as a host path; the rest of the agent directory is not. |
| `PI_WARDEN_SCRATCH_PATHS=<dir>:<dir>` | Scratch roots the host declares, `:`-separated. A recursive `rm` whose every target is strictly inside one of them, after `..` and symlinks are resolved, warns (`rm-session-scratch`, risky) instead of holding. A root that is `/`, the home directory, the project root (the session's working directory), or a git working tree (it contains `.git`), a relative entry, and an empty entry are ignored, and a session names every ignored entry and its reason once. Read once per session. Environment only: no config file can set or extend it. |

When a guard would ask Jev but cannot, Warden tells you once per session and reason why, and what to do: no consent (`/warden enable`, or `PI_WARDEN_ENABLED=1` headless), a refused `typesafeBackend` (the refusal message, quoted; fix the value in the user config), no key for the backend (set its key variable, or run `/typesafe login` for the TypeSafe backend), or a rejected key (named by where it comes from: run `/typesafe login` again for the key it saved, or check the key in the environment variable and run `/warden status`); a headless session gets a status message instead of a notice, and a spent request budget keeps its own warning.

### Trace file

With `PI_WARDEN_TRACE_DIR` set to an absolute path, Warden appends every trace event to `<path>/<session id>.jsonl`. The directory is created owner-only (`0700`) when it is missing; the file is owner-only (`0600`). A new or resumed session writes to its own file. The file keeps every event: the 100-entry limit of the sidebar does not apply. Each line is one JSON object with `"v": 1` and a `kind`:

| `kind` | Written | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session` | Once when the session opens the file | `sessionId`; `cwd` (the home directory shown as `~`, redacted); `wardenVersion`; `mode` (`steer`, `confirm`, or `advise`); `judgments` (`on`, or `off:<reason>` with reason `no_consent`, `no_key`, `key_rejected`, or `budget`); `at` |
| `judgments` | When a guard finds the judgment state changed from the last `session` or `judgments` line | `judgments` (same values as on `session`); `at` |
| `entry` | For every trace event | `id` (a number, unique in the file; a reload continues the count); `at`; `guard`; `line` (the status-line text); `details` (the redacted detail lines the sidebar shows); `tokens` (the widget tokens, when the event has them) |
| `amend` | When an outcome lands on an event that is still in the sidebar's 100 entries | `id` of the entry; `line` (the added detail line); `at` |

`at` is an ISO 8601 timestamp. Lines are in trace order. A write error is reported once as a warning and stops the file for the rest of the session; guards and tool calls do not change. In RPC mode `/warden trace` sends the last 20 events as one text notification, newest last, with the path of this file when it is on.


## Status line and trace sidebar

The line above the editor shows the latest verdict per guard. The verdict leads as a chip, the guard follows, and the body reads as data:

```text
OK     rules · prose · done
WARN   action  write · irreversible 0.09 · off-task 0.95 · unrelated · slop: none · off task
       context bash · duplicate · saved 1024 bytes
```

A verdict the guard found nothing in (`ok`, `allow`, `skipped`) folds into one line per verdict naming the guards that spoke, so a quiet turn costs one line instead of one per guard. A quiet verdict keeps its own line when the line names a finding or a caveat (`typesafe error`, `user approved`, `slop: <symptom>`, `patterns: <id>`), because folding it would report a verdict the guard did not give. The worst verdict sits last, nearest the editor. Folded detail is not lost: `/warden status` prints the raw line per guard under `Last:`, and the sidebar keeps every event with its scores.

`/warden trace`, `ctrl+shift+w`, and a click on the line each toggle a right-hand sidebar with the full trace, newest first, live. The sidebar does not take the keyboard; click inside it for arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn, `c` clears, Esc hands input back, `q` closes. `widget.panelWidth` sets its width.

Clicks and the wheel need Pi's fullscreen mode (`tuiMode: "fullscreen"` in `/settings`). In macOS Terminal.app enable View → Allow Mouse Reporting.

Templates in `config.widget` control the text. Segments are separated by ` · `; a segment whose token has no value is dropped. A template should end on `{level}` or `{status}`: that trailing word becomes the chip. A template that keeps the level mid-line gives the line no chip, and the guard name leads it instead:

```json
"widget": {
  "action": "warden · {tool} · irreversible {irreversible} · off-task {offTask} · {scope} · slop: {slop} · patterns: {patterns} · {flags} · {level}",
  "rules": "warden · rules · {tool} {path} · {asked} rules · {violations} · {status}",
  "stuck": "warden · stuck · {failures} failures · same strategy {sameStrategy} · change {approachChange} · progress {progress} · {flags} · {status}",
  "done": "warden · done-check · {changes} changes · {checksPassed}/{checks} checks passed · claims done {claimsDone} · claims verified {claimsVerified} · checks apply {checksApply} · {outcome} · {status}",
  "prose": "warden · prose · wordy {wordy} · clichés {cliches} · jargon {jargon} · {flags} · {status}",
  "security": "warden · security · {tool} · injection {injection} · exfiltration {exfiltration} · {status}",
  "context": "warden · context · {tool} · {retention} · saved {bytesSaved} bytes",
  "runaway": "warden · runaway · {kind} · {count}× repeated · {chars} chars · {signal} · {status}",
  "subagent": "warden · subagent · {agent} · {kind} · {wake} · {status}"
}
```

Tokens per guard:

| Guard | Tokens |
| --- | --- |
| action | `tool level source irreversible offTask scope approved intent visible largeOutput plan slop slopStub slopComments slopDead slopHedging patterns reasons path model ms flags time` |
| rules | `tool path asked violations status source reasons model ms flags time` |

| security | `tool injection exfiltration status` |
| context | `tool retention bytesSaved` |
| runaway | `kind count chars signal block status time` |
| subagent | `agent kind wake status time` |

`"enabled": false` hides the line; `"shortcut": ""` disables the keybinding.

## After updating the package

Restart Pi after an update; `/reload` re-imports the entry module but can leave older modules of the same package in memory. Since 0.5.2 the extension checks the shape of the config it receives; a section that an older module does not know (the symptom of two package versions in one process) switches that guard off and prints one warning naming the sections and the schema numbers. 0.9.0 crashed instead when the shape-check module itself was the stale one; since 0.9.1 the extension guards the sections it reads in its own module, so the warning appears and everything else keeps working. If you see the warning, restart Pi.
